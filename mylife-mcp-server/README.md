# README

MyLife is an AI-Agent platform that helps you capture, shape and share you cherished memories, wisdom, stories, ideas and more. This Nanda server is the first decentralized effort for sustainability and security. Currently one can only retrieve public memories, and receive basic elements. Next step is to create reliving memory experiences.

This codebase works currently as-is on my local with /venv installed, perhaps I am missing a dependency in requirements? It was done by hand. And then there may be the port confusion at the end of `server.py` which might result in unexpected outcomes when web-app'd.

If there are any questions, reach me at erikj@humanremembranceproject.org or any contact element here.
