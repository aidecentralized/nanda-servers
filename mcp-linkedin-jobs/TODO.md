* Add logging like: [Dbug | Info | Error][LinkedinService] log

* Need to add some version of "Next" - pagination perhaps

Optimisations:
* adding type validation for the linkedin return
* Include metadata about the search (total results, pagination info)?
for metadata, would you like to include:
Total count of jobs available?
Current page information?
Rate limiting information?
Search criteria used?
